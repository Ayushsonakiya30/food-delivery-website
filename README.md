index.html: The following HTML code describes the structure of the webpage. First of all it has an header tag to display the name of the company which is “MyOnlineMeal”. The navigation bar contains tabs of “Home”, “Services”, “Our Clients” and “ContactUs”. The navigation bar also consists of the logo of the company followed by the background image with some more details of the “MyOnlineMeal” along with the featured products.\

<hr>
style.css: This is the stylesheet block which gives us the proper look of the webpage.
Header styling: It consists of two “head” tags. We have used font-style “bree serif” to style the header and we also used proper colors to make some text look attractive.
Navigation bar styling: It basically consists of logo styling and content styling. First of all we have considered the navigation bar as a flexbox and assigned the flex-direction to “column”. Then we considered the content of the navigation bar as a flexbox and then we have positioned it properly.
Background image styling: We used before pseudo selectors to set the respective background images.
